Current Versions of Galactic 2D Supported: 0.0.0.1

Compiling a Galactic 2D Project:

To compile a G2D Game, you need to load up the sample project in a relevant C++ editor, and then add the included Galactic 2D Binary files (Header / Library) to the list of project dependancies to properly load in the G2D References for your .DLL/.SO/.APP From there, use the template classes included to build your solution.

Running a Compiled Project:

To run a compiled .DLL you need to run an instance of Galactic 2D using the -game argument that points to the file name of the dynamic library. The engine will automatically load the relevant main.lua file included in the same directory as the library.
